Development History
---------------------------
Aim: To create a project management tool.

1. It is too tough to start with all known functinalities. 
   Let start with simple todo list with list/add/edit/remove/mark as completed and 
   mark as uncompleted functionality

2. To start with I spend time in choosing the application layout.
   I like to go with responsive design from initial stage. I tried twitter bootstrap and foundation.
   Atlast I like to go with foundation. One thing which impress me is flat design and ability to use sass
